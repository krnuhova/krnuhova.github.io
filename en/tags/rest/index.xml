      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-july-16--july-22&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week of July 16 â€“ July 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was spent outdoors â€” together with friends we went out of town. It felt great to change the environment after the stressful exams and the hustle of city life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A campfire, forest walks, and late-night conversations helped me reset. I even managed to solve a couple of programming problems on my laptop â€” the brain keeps seeking activity anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;such-a-balance--rest-combined-with-a-bit-of-study--turned-out-to-be-very-beneficial&#34;&gt;Such a balance â€” rest combined with a bit of study â€” turned out to be very beneficial.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>First Days of Vacation â€” Rest After a Stressful Exam Session</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-july-2--july-8&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week of July 2 â€“ July 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session is behind me, and now I can finally take a breath. The first days of vacation are all about well-deserved rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the week I spent at home â€” catching up on sleep and enjoying the freedom of having no strict schedule. At last, I had time to read books outside the academic program and spend quality moments with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vacation-has-just-begun-and-there-are-plenty-of-plans-ahead-trips-new-hobbies-and-self-development&#34;&gt;The vacation has just begun, and there are plenty of plans ahead: trips, new hobbies, and self-development.&lt;/h2&gt;
