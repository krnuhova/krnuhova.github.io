      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-july-9--july-15&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week of July 9 â€“ July 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the vacation became more active. I met with classmates, we walked around Moscow together and discussed our plans for the upcoming academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also visited a digital technology exhibition â€” it was fascinating to see real examples of how artificial intelligence and automation are applied in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

The vacation is becoming not only a time for rest, but also an opportunity to grow in areas that truly inspire me.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-of-july-2--july-8&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week of July 2 â€“ July 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session is behind me, and now I can finally take a breath. The first days of vacation are all about well-deserved rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the week I spent at home â€” catching up on sleep and enjoying the freedom of having no strict schedule. At last, I had time to read books outside the academic program and spend quality moments with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vacation-has-just-begun-and-there-are-plenty-of-plans-ahead-trips-new-hobbies-and-self-development&#34;&gt;The vacation has just begun, and there are plenty of plans ahead: trips, new hobbies, and self-development.&lt;/h2&gt;
